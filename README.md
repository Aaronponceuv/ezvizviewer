This project was started as part of my 100 days of code challenge.

I mainly run Linux on my computers at home and have an ezviz CCTV
 system at home that is only accessible using an Android application
 or Internet Explorer. 
 
I want to view the cameras from my Linux desktops using an application
 and this application is what I am working on to get to that goal.
 
I'm using resources from https://github.com/statueofmike RSTP repository
 as well as https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python and also https://pypi.org/project/rtsp/
 
 
I had to install pip3 to install the python rtsp library.
Had issues with the RTSP URL as the URL that works using VLC gave me 401 authentication issues
 when trying to access it from ezvizviewer.py
